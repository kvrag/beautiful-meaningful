# What's Next?
## An app for simple reflection &amp; self-care

Everyone has had that moment of inertia, when life has dealt you a hand and you're not sure which card to play. Maybe you're in bed, staring at the ceiling. Maybe you just moved to a new city, and leaving your apartment feels like too much just yet. Or maybe life is great, and you want to celebrate somehow.

Tell What's Next? how your day is going. Using the [Emoj API](https://medium.com/@dannyfreed/today-im-launching-emoj-an-api-that-can-interpret-emotion-from-a-text-based-conversation-6b2ea3fa98b), What's Next? analyzes your emotional state and chooses an array of small, manageable, low-stakes activities that might make your day a little brighter, or start you on the right direction for what comes after. Spin the wheel to generate a particular activity. Spin it again until you find something that feels right to you.

And if all else fails, there's always [kittens](https://placekitten.com).
